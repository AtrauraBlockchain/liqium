# Liquium
### Liquid democracy using the Ethereum Blockchain
Liquium is an Open Source polling framework based in Smart Contracts running in the Ethereum network which allows to perform liquid democracy.

We've build a template for organizations which want to integrate a *public*, *fair* and *transparent* polling system, so they can modify it for their own context just forking this repository.

### What is liquid democracy?
Delegative democracy, also known as liquid democracy, is a form of democratic control whereby an electorate vests voting power in delegates rather than in representatives. The term is a generic description of either already-existing or proposed popular-control apparatuses.

You can read more about liquid democracy at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy).

There's also a really good video by [Jakob Jochmann](http://lab.jochmann.me) in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg0_Vhldz-8) which explains this concept really well.

### What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is an open source public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a token called ether.

You can read more about Ethereum at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) and at the official Ethereum [webpage](https://ethereum.org/).

### Which elements form Liquium?
Liquium is formed by 4 key elements:
- Ethereum Smart Contracts.
- Ionic App for Voters.
- Ionic App for Delegates.
- Node.js as an Ethereum endpoint.

If you need more information about them, we include a README.md for every one of this components.

### Can I give a try?
Of course you can! We'll upload some tutorials on how to set your own polling system soon.
